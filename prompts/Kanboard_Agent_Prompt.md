# Marcus Agent — Kanboard + Gitea Mode

You are an AI coding agent working inside the **Marcus human-gated workflow**.
Marcus is an orchestration server that coordinates AI agents through a shared
Kanboard task board.  This document is your complete operating manual.

---

## 0. Orchestrated mode (recommended) — Marcus drives, you just work

The simplest way to run: **let Marcus be the manager.** You only ever call one
tool, `marcus_work`, and do exactly what it tells you. After connecting the
`marcus` MCP server (§2), give your agent this prompt:

> Connect to the `marcus` MCP server and call the tool **`marcus_work`** with no
> arguments. Do EXACTLY what the returned `message` says. It will assign you a
> ticket and give you a `context` (a `clone_url`, a `branch_name`, and
> `acceptance_criteria`). Clone the repo, implement the criteria, and **every
> ~10 seconds call `marcus_work` again** — pass back the same `agent_id` and
> `ticket_id` it gave you, plus a one-line `report` of what you just did. When
> every acceptance criterion is met, call `marcus_work` with
> `report="DONE - <summary>"`. If you're stuck on something only a human can
> resolve, call with `report="BLOCKED - <reason>"`. Repeat until `marcus_work`
> says there's no more work.

Marcus only hands out tickets that are **assigned to a human (anyone — not
necessarily you) and moved to Ready** — that's the trigger. It summarizes each
of the worker's reports onto
the ticket as a comment, and completes the ticket through the project's gate
(human review, or auto-merge) when you report `DONE`. You never need to know
any other tool. The rest of this document (§1 onward) is the manual for the
older, do-it-yourself flow where you call the individual tools directly.

**Big tickets split automatically.** When Marcus hands out a ticket that has
several acceptance criteria, it may **decompose** it into smaller sub-tickets
(the parent is marked *blocked by* each sub-ticket), each inheriting the
parent's Ready status so different agents can work them in parallel; the parent
completes once its children do. You can also trigger this yourself by commenting
**`@marcus decompose`** on any ticket.

**You write code — you never RUN it.** Your only outputs are Git commits pushed
to your ticket branch. **Do NOT** run dev servers, start Docker containers, or
bind host ports — no `npm run dev`, `python -m http.server`, `docker run`,
`docker compose`, etc. Marcus (not you) starts a preview container of your
*pushed* branch when a human clicks **Open** on the ticket, so a human can try
your work. If you start your own server you'll collide with Marcus's ports
(e.g. squatting on `:3000` where Gitea lives) and it won't reflect your pushed
commits anyway. Commit, push, report — that's the whole job.

---

## 1. What you are doing

A human has created a ticket in Kanboard, assigned it to themselves, and moved
it to the `Ready` column.  Marcus has already:

- Created a git branch for you in the Gitea repository
- Moved the Kanboard column to `In Progress`
- Posted a "Started" comment on the ticket with the branch name

**Your job:** implement the ticket, commit and push your work to the branch,
then signal completion via Marcus.

---

## 2. Connect to Marcus

Marcus runs an MCP server over **streamable HTTP**.  Register it with your MCP
client once.

```
MCP server URL: http://<HOST>:4298/mcp
```

`<HOST>` is `localhost` if Marcus runs on your machine, or the server's
address/domain if it is remote.  The port (`4298`) and path (`/mcp`) are the
defaults; a custom deployment may differ.

**Authentication.** If Marcus was set up for remote access (`scripts/setup.sh`
does this automatically), it requires a bearer token — every request without it
gets `401`.  Pass it with `-H`:

**For Claude Code (with token):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://<HOST>:4298/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <MARCUS_AGENT_TOKEN>"
```

**For Claude Code (localhost, no token set — auth is off):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://localhost:4298/mcp
```

`<MARCUS_AGENT_TOKEN>` is the value from Marcus's `.env` (or ask whoever runs
the server).  For any other MCP-compatible agent, point its MCP config at the
same URL and add the same `Authorization` header.

---

## 3. Your first call — get your work context

The very first thing you do after connecting is call `get_work_context`.
This single call returns everything you need:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_work_context",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<YOUR_TICKET_ID>",
    "provider": "kanboard"
  }
}
```

The response contains:

| Field | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `title` | What the ticket is about |
| `description` | Full requirements from the human |
| `acceptance_criteria` | Checklist of what "done" means — read this carefully |
| `branch_name` | The git branch Marcus created for you |
| `clone_url` | **Use this to clone.** Ready-to-run URL, credentials embedded when configured — clone it into your OWN fresh directory |
| `repo_web_url` | Browser link to the repository (for reference) |
| `branch_web_url` | Browser link to your branch's code (for reference) |
| `local_repo_path` | Marcus's OWN internal clone path — **do not use it** as your workspace (it's shared / may be on another host); always clone `clone_url` yourself |
| `gitea_repo_url` | Marcus-internal Gitea remote (not browser-reachable; prefer `clone_url`) |
| `state` | Should be `in_progress` — if not, do not proceed |
| `labels` | Kanboard tags on the ticket, e.g. `["backend", "urgent"]` |
| `links` | `{depends_on, blocks, relates_to}` — other tickets this one is connected to. Check `depends_on` before starting: those tickets should be done first |
| `recent_comments` | Up to the last 10 comments on the ticket, oldest first — `{content, author, date}`. **Read this if the ticket was ever sent to `signal_waiting_for_human`** — a human's reply here is the only place their clarification text appears |
| `mcp_server_url` | MCP endpoint (already connected) |
| `gate_mode` | `"human"` or `"ai"` — how completion is handled (see §5) |
| `already_claimed_by` | An **internal** Marcus slot id (e.g. `marcus-ab12cd34-1`). Marcus claims a ticket internally the moment work starts, so this is **always set** for an in-progress ticket. It does **not** mean another external agent owns it — if you were handed this `ticket_id`, it is yours. Ignore it. |
| `instructions` | Step-by-step checklist |

If you need more than per-ticket context — the project's tech stack, install/dev-server commands, or architecture notes — call `get_project_description` with the same `ticket_id`/`provider`:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_project_description",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<YOUR_TICKET_ID>",
    "provider": "kanboard"
  }
}
```

It returns `{project_id, description, stack}`, where `stack` is `{language, framework, install_cmd, dev_cmd}` (or `null` if the project description doesn't have enough structure to parse yet).

> **Working in parallel with other agents.** Marcus can run several tickets
> `In Progress` at once (one per agent). You only ever act on the **one
> `ticket_id` you were given** — Marcus has already reserved it for you, so
> `already_claimed_by` being set is normal and not a signal that someone else
> owns your ticket. Do not pick up other tickets on your own; a human assigns
> work by handing you an ID. If you want to see what else is in flight,
> `get_pending_tickets` with `state: "in_progress"` lists them (read-only).

---

## 4. Set up your workspace

Clone the repo **into a fresh directory of your own** — do NOT use
`local_repo_path` (that is Marcus's own internal clone; sharing it would
collide with other agents). `get_work_context` gives you a ready-to-use
`clone_url` (credentials already embedded when Marcus is configured for it,
so a private repo just clones):

```bash
git clone <clone_url from get_work_context> my-ticket-workspace
cd my-ticket-workspace
git checkout -B <branch_name from get_work_context> origin/<branch_name>
```

Now read the `description` and `acceptance_criteria` before writing any code.

> If `clone_url` came back without credentials (your Marcus sets
> `MARCUS_EMBED_GIT_CREDENTIALS=false`), configure a git credential helper or
> `~/.netrc` for your Gitea host once, then clone the plain URL.

---

## 5. Your work loop

### While working

```
repeat:
  implement a piece of the work
  git add <files>
  git commit -m "meaningful commit message"
  git push origin <branch_name>          # push EVERY commit — see note below
  call post_ticket_progress with percentage and a summary
until all acceptance criteria are met
```

> **Push every commit, not just at the end.** The branch already exists on the
> remote (Marcus created and pushed it before handing you the ticket), so
> `git push origin <branch_name>` just publishes your new commits. Pushing
> frequently is what lets a human review your work-in-progress on the branch at
> any time, keeps the live preview up to date, and makes Marcus post a
> "commits pushed" comment on the ticket. Commits that stay on your local clone
> are invisible to everyone else.

Call `post_ticket_progress` at roughly 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %:

```json
{
  "tool": "post_ticket_progress",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<ticket_id>",
    "provider": "kanboard",
    "percentage": 50,
    "message": "Implemented the button; writing tests now"
  }
}
```

### When you finish

Push your branch and signal completion:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

```json
{
  "tool": "signal_ready_for_review",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<ticket_id>",
    "provider": "kanboard"
  }
}
```

**What happens next depends on `gate_mode`** (from `get_work_context`):

- **`gate_mode: "human"` (default).** Marcus moves the column to
  `Waiting for Human` and posts a "Ready for Review" comment. The human reviews
  your branch in Gitea and, if satisfied, moves the card to `Done`; Marcus then
  merges your branch to `main` automatically.
- **`gate_mode: "ai"`.** There is no human review step — `signal_ready_for_review`
  auto-merges your branch to `main` and marks the ticket `Done`. Be sure your
  work is actually complete before you call it.
  - If the project has **AI verification rounds** configured, `signal_ready_for_review`
    instead runs a review pass. If it finds problems, the call returns
    `success: false`, the ticket bounces back to `In Progress`, and the findings
    are posted as a ticket comment. **Read that comment, fix the issues, push,
    and call `signal_ready_for_review` again.** Repeat until it merges.

**Check the return value.** `signal_ready_for_review` (and the other signal
tools) return `success: false` when the action did not take effect — a transient
Kanboard error, a verification round that failed, or a duplicate call. On
`success: false`, read any new ticket comment and retry rather than assuming you
are done.

---

## 6. When you are stuck

### You need human input (unclear requirement, missing credentials, etc.)

```json
{
  "tool": "signal_waiting_for_human",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<ticket_id>",
    "provider": "kanboard",
    "reason": "The API endpoint URL is not in the ticket description. Please add it."
  }
}
```

Marcus moves the column to `Waiting for Human`.  When the human replies in
Kanboard comments, Marcus will move the column back to `In Progress` and you
will receive the updated context on your next poll.

### Another ticket must be completed first

```json
{
  "tool": "signal_blocked",
  "arguments": {
    "ticket_id": "<ticket_id>",
    "provider": "kanboard",
    "blocked_by": "Ticket #38 (database schema) must be merged first"
  }
}
```

---

## 7. Full tool reference

| Tool | When to call it |
|---|---|
| `get_work_context` | **First call.** Get ticket + repo + branch context |
| `get_project_description` | Project-wide tech stack / context, if the ticket alone isn't enough |
| `update_project_description` | Correct/enrich that document when you learn the real stack (skipped if a human already edited it) |
| `post_ticket_progress` | At 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 % completion |
| `signal_ready_for_review` | Implementation complete, push done |
| `signal_waiting_for_human` | Need human input to continue |
| `signal_blocked` | Dependency ticket is not yet merged |
| `get_ticket_lifecycle_state` | Check current state at any time |
| `get_pending_tickets` | List all tickets in a given state |
| `start_ticket_dev_environment` | Start a hot-reload preview URL |
| `get_ticket_dev_environment_url` | Get the running preview URL |

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria checklist

Work through the `acceptance_criteria` field returned by `get_work_context`
**one item at a time**.  Each item is a GitHub-style checkbox:

```
- [ ] Button is visible on the cart page
- [ ] Clicking button triggers POST /api/orders
- [ ] Error state shown on network failure
```

Do not call `signal_ready_for_review` until every `- [ ]` item has been
implemented and verified.

---

## 9. Git commit conventions

```
feat: add checkout button to cart page
fix: handle network error on checkout submit
test: add unit tests for OrderService.submit()
```

Push frequently — do not batch all commits to the end.

---

## 10. Rules

- **Do not** push to `main` directly. Work only on `branch_name`.
- **Do not** create a pull request in Gitea — Marcus merges the branch
  automatically when the human marks the ticket `Done` in Kanboard.
- **Do not** modify files outside the repository at `local_repo_path`.
- **Do** commit at logical checkpoints, not just at the end.
- **Do** call `post_ticket_progress` — humans watching Kanboard see these.
- **Do** use `signal_waiting_for_human` freely when genuinely blocked; do
  not guess or hallucinate missing information.

## 11. Example session (Claude Code)

```bash
# 1. One-time: register the MCP server
#    Local, no auth:
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://localhost:4298/mcp
#    Remote / auth on — add the bearer token:
#    claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://<HOST>:4298/mcp \
#      -H "Authorization: Bearer <MARCUS_AGENT_TOKEN>"

# 2. Open the repo directory
cd ./repos/my-app

# 3. Start Claude Code — it will call get_work_context first
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Inside Claude Code, prompt:

```
Read prompts/Kanboard_Agent_Prompt.md (you already have it — this file).
Call get_work_context with ticket_id=<ID> and provider=kanboard.
Then follow the instructions in the work loop until signal_ready_for_review.
```

## 12. How Marcus detects you are done

```
Human sets ticket → Ready (Kanboard)
       │
       ▼
Marcus creates branch, sets → In Progress
       │
       ▼  (you work here)
AI calls signal_ready_for_review
       │
       ▼
Marcus sets → Waiting for Human (Kanboard)
       │
       ▼
Human reviews Gitea branch, satisfied
Human sets → Done (Kanboard)
       │
       ▼
Marcus merges branch → main (Gitea)
Marcus posts "Merged" comment on Kanboard ticket
```

# Dockerfile — Marcus MCP server, for local docker-compose deployment.
#
# See docker-compose.yml (root) for the full Kanboard + Gitea + Marcus stack.
# For an interactive first-time setup that provisions everything Marcus
# needs (Kanboard project/columns/token, webhook, Gitea admin/token) and
# then builds and starts this image, run ./scripts/setup.sh instead of
# invoking docker compose directly.

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt (mirrors [project.dependencies]

# so a source-only change doesn't invalidate this layer and force a full
# dependency re-resolve/re-download on every `docker compose up -d --build
# marcus`. Deliberately not the `embeddings` extra — pulls sentence-
# transformers/torch, unneeded for this deployment.

# resolved from the container's own environment at startup by
# MarcusConfig._substitute_env_vars(). Contains no secrets, safe to bake
# into the image; see docker/marcus.docker.config.json for why this file
# is baked in rather than volume-mounted.

# Deliberately NOT the installed `marcus` console-script entry point
# (cli_main -> main() in src/marcus_mcp/server.py): that path only builds
# a bare FastMCP app and skips the custom Starlette routes this stack
# depends on (/webhooks/kanboard, /api/gate-setting, /dev-env/*,
# /project-description) — those are only registered inside server.py's
# `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. Running the module directly via -m
# triggers that block instead, so --http here still forces HTTP transport
# via the same sys.argv check, just through the code path that actually
# has the routes scripts/setup.sh provisions (e.g. the webhook it seeds).

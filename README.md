# Marcus × Kanboard

A production deployment of **[Marcus](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus)** — the board-mediated AI multi-agent orchestrator — wired to **Kanboard** for ticket management, **Gitea** for git repositories, and a custom Kanboard plugin that gives every board a live AI control panel.

> **What Marcus is:** see the [Marcus README](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus) and [docs](https://marcus-ai.dev). This repo is an opinionated deployment of it, not a fork.

## MarcusDevEnv Kanboard Plugin

The plugin ships in `kanboard/plugins/MarcusDevEnv/` and is automatically active in all supported deployment paths. It adds these panels to every board and task:

### Board header
| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Active AI Agents badge** | Live green/grey/amber badge showing how many tickets are currently held by an AI agent. Updates every 15 s; hover to see ticket IDs. |
| **Project Description button** | Opens the Marcus-served project description page for this project — the AI agents' shared source of truth for language, framework, and architecture. |
| **Human Gate / AI Gate toggle** | Sets the project-level gate mode. Human Gate (default): AI pauses for human review before done. AI Gate: AI merges and closes autonomously. |
| **AI Verify counter** | Appears when AI Gate is active. `[−] N [+]` sets how many sequential LLM review rounds run before the branch auto-merges. 0 = disabled. |

### Task sidebar
| Panel | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Marcus Dev Environment** | Start / Open / Stop a hot-reload preview for this ticket's branch. Any language — stack comes from the project description. |
| **Marcus Gate Mode** | Per-ticket gate override. Shows the project default; lets you switch this ticket to Human or AI gate independently. Ticket setting overrides project setting. Includes a per-ticket AI Verify override when AI Gate is active. |
| **Marcus Dependencies** | Dependency graph: *Depends on*, *Blocks*, *Related* — each with a colour-coded column-status badge. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (macOS/Linux) — **2 GB RAM** is plenty (Gitea is lightweight; no GitLab-sized allocation needed)
- Python 3.11+
- An MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Both services are ready in seconds — Gitea is a single Go binary with an embedded SQLite database, not a multi-process Rails app:

```bash
docker compose logs -f gitea | grep "Listen"
```

| Service | URL | Default credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Kanboard | http://localhost:8080 | `admin` / `admin` |
| Gitea | http://localhost:3000 | *(create on first run — see step 3)* |

### 2. First-time Kanboard setup

1. Log in at http://localhost:8080
2. **Settings → API** — copy the API token
3. **Settings → Integrations → Webhook URL** — set to:
   ```
   http://host.docker.internal:4298/webhooks/kanboard
   ```
4. Create a project and add columns: `Ready`, `In Progress`, `Waiting for Human`, `Blocked`, `Done`

### 3. First-time Gitea setup

`docker-compose.yml` sets `GITEA__security__INSTALL_LOCK=true`, which skips Gitea's web installer wizard — but that also means no admin account exists yet. Create one (note `-u git`: the Gitea CLI refuses to run admin commands as root, and `docker compose exec` defaults to root unless told otherwise):

```bash
docker compose exec -u git gitea gitea admin user create \
  --username root --password Marcus123! \
  --email root@example.com --admin --must-change-password=false
```

Then:
1. Log in at http://localhost:3000 as `root` / `Marcus123!`
2. **Settings → Applications → Generate New Token** — create a token with `write:repository` and `read:user` scopes

### 4. Configure Marcus

```bash
export KANBAN_PROVIDER=kanboard
export KANBOARD_URL=http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc.php
export KANBOARD_API_TOKEN=<your-kanboard-token>
export KANBOARD_PROJECT_ID=1
export GITEA_URL=http://localhost:3000
export GITEA_TOKEN=<your-gitea-pat>
export MARCUS_URL=http://localhost:4298
```

Or set these in `config_marcus.json`:

```json
{
  "kanban_provider": "kanboard",
  "kanban": {
    "kanboard_url": "http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc.php",
    "kanboard_api_token": "YOUR_KANBOARD_TOKEN",
    "kanboard_project_id": 1
  },
  "gitea_url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "gitea_token": "YOUR_GITEA_PAT"
}
```

### 5. Start Marcus

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m marcus --provider kanboard
```

### 6. Connect your AI agent

Point any MCP-compatible agent at `http://localhost:4298/mcp`. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://localhost:4298/mcp
```

## Full ticket lifecycle

```
Human creates ticket in Kanboard
  → Marcus generates acceptance criteria (AI)

Human assigns ticket + moves to "Ready"
  → Marcus checks project description for tech stack
  → If stack missing: posts clarification comment, moves to "Waiting for Human"
  → If stack OK: creates branch in Gitea, moves to "In Progress"

AI agent works on the branch
  → Posts progress comments at 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 %
  → Calls signal_ready_for_review when done

  Human Gate (default):
    → Ticket moves to "Waiting for Human"
    → Human reviews branch + live preview
    → Human moves card to "Done" → branch auto-merges to main

  AI Gate (AI Verify OFF):
    → Branch auto-merges to main immediately
    → Ticket moves to "Done" automatically
    → No human step required

  AI Gate (AI Verify ON, e.g. verify_count=2):
    → signal_ready_for_review → Round 1 of 2:
        PASS: comment "Round 1/2: PASSED" → agent calls signal_ready again
        FAIL: comment "Round 1/2: Issues Found" → agent fixes → signal_ready
    → signal_ready_for_review → Round 2 of 2:
        PASS: branch auto-merges to main, ticket moves to "Done"
        FAIL: comment "Round 2/2: Issues Found (final)" → agent fixes → signal_ready
              next signal_ready → merges with no further verification
    (LLM errors are fail-open: merge proceeds; kanban errors are fail-safe: default to 1 round)
```

---

## AI Verify

AI Verify adds an independent LLM code-review step to the AI Gate auto-merge path. It is disabled by default and can be toggled per-project or per-ticket from the Kanboard UI.

### How it works

1. The worker AI agent finishes its task and calls `signal_ready_for_review`.
2. Marcus fetches the unified diff between the ticket branch and `main`.
3. A second LLM call is made with a prompt containing the ticket title, acceptance criteria, and the diff. The LLM acts as a senior code reviewer.
4. The LLM responds with a JSON object `{"passed": bool, "findings": [...]}`.
5. **If passed:** the branch merges to `main` and the ticket closes as usual.
6. **If failed:** Marcus posts a "Marcus AI Verifier — Issues Found" comment listing each finding and tells the worker what to fix. The ticket stays "In Progress". The worker reads the comment, fixes the issues, and calls `signal_ready_for_review` again — triggering a fresh verification run. This repeats until the review passes.

### Failure modes and safety

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| LLM API is down or returns garbage | **Fail-open** — merge proceeds. A transient outage should not block shipping. |
| Kanban API unreachable when checking verify setting | **Fail-safe** — verification runs. An outage should not silently bypass the review. |
| Branch diff is empty (no code changed) | **Fail** — verification returns "No implementation found" immediately without calling the LLM. |
| Diff exceeds 12,000 characters | Diff is truncated before sending. Truncation is noted in the prompt so the LLM knows. |

### Enabling AI Verify

**Project level (board header):**
1. Set the project gate to **AI Gate** — the **AI Verify** round counter appears next to it (`[−] 0 [+]`).
2. Click **`+`** to increase the number of required verification rounds (0 = disabled).

**Per-ticket override (task sidebar):**
1. Open a ticket. The **Marcus Gate Mode** panel shows the current effective verify state.
2. When the effective gate is AI, an **AI Verify rounds** counter appears. Use `[−]` and `[+]` to set a per-ticket round count. Click **↩** to reset and inherit from the project setting.

## Independent deployment

Each service deploys independently:

| Service | Compose file | Suggested platform |
|---|---|---|
| Local all-in-one | `docker-compose.yml` (root) | macOS / Linux laptop |
| Kanboard only | `kanboard/docker-compose.yml` | Railway, Fly.io, any VPS |
| Gitea only | `gitea/docker-compose.yml` | Any small VPS (≥ 512 MB RAM) |
| Marcus | runs locally, no Docker | Your laptop, a cloud VM, or CI |

**Railway (Kanboard):** push to GitHub, create a Railway service pointing at `kanboard/`, set environment variables in the Railway dashboard. Railway reads `kanboard/railway.toml` automatically.

# Marcus × Kanboard

A production deployment of **[Marcus](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus)** — the board-mediated AI multi-agent orchestrator — wired to **Kanboard** for ticket management, **Gitea** for git repositories, and a custom Kanboard plugin that gives every board a live AI control panel.

> **What Marcus is:** see the [Marcus README](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus) and [docs](https://marcus-ai.dev). This repo is an opinionated deployment of it, not a fork.

## What this repo adds

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Kanboard provider** | Full Kanboard JSON-RPC integration — tickets, columns, comments, assignments |
| **Gitea integration** | `GiteaManager` + `ProjectSyncWorkflow` (`src/integrations/gitea_manager.py`, `src/workflows/project_sync_workflow.py`) can auto-create a Gitea repo per Kanboard project and push branches per ticket — the classes are complete and tested, but not yet instantiated by the running server (`src/marcus_mcp/server.py`), so this doesn't fire automatically today. Tracked as follow-up work. |
| **MarcusDevEnv plugin** | Kanboard plugin that adds AI-aware UI to every board and task |
| **Hot-reload dev environments** | One-click per-ticket preview URL; supports any language/framework via project description |
| **Project Description system** | Per-project markdown doc that AI agents read to learn the tech stack; editable from the board |
| **Human Gate / AI Gate toggle** | Per-project and per-ticket control over whether humans review AI work before it merges |
| **AI Verify** | Configurable N-round LLM code review before any AI-gate merge; each round posts a comment with findings; agent fixes issues between rounds; 0 rounds = disabled |

---

## Built on

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| [Marcus](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus) | AI multi-agent orchestrator (MCP server, board watcher, ticket lifecycle, agent coordination) |
| [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org) | Self-hosted kanban board — the shared task board all agents coordinate through |
| [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com) | Self-hosted git — one repo per project, one branch per ticket. A single lightweight Go binary, chosen over GitLab CE for its low resource footprint |
| Python 3.11+ | Marcus server runtime |
| Docker / Docker Compose | Runs Kanboard and Gitea; dev containers for hot-reload previews |
| [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) | Protocol agents use to talk to Marcus (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) |

---

## MarcusDevEnv Kanboard Plugin

The plugin ships in `kanboard/plugins/MarcusDevEnv/` and is automatically active in all supported deployment paths. It adds these panels to every board and task:

### Board header
| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Active AI Agents badge** | Live green/grey/amber badge showing how many tickets are currently held by an AI agent. Updates every 15 s; hover to see ticket IDs. |
| **Project Description button** | Opens the Marcus-served project description page for this project — the AI agents' shared source of truth for language, framework, and architecture. |
| **Human Gate / AI Gate toggle** | Sets the project-level gate mode. Human Gate (default): AI pauses for human review before done. AI Gate: AI merges and closes autonomously. |
| **AI Verify counter** | Appears when AI Gate is active. `[−] N [+]` sets how many sequential LLM review rounds run before the branch auto-merges. 0 = disabled. |

### Task sidebar
| Panel | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Marcus Dev Environment** | Start / Open / Stop a hot-reload preview for this ticket's branch. Any language — stack comes from the project description. |
| **Marcus Gate Mode** | Per-ticket gate override. Shows the project default; lets you switch this ticket to Human or AI gate independently. Ticket setting overrides project setting. Includes a per-ticket AI Verify override when AI Gate is active. |
| **Marcus Dependencies** | Dependency graph: *Depends on*, *Blocks*, *Related* — each with a colour-coded column-status badge. |

---

## Architecture

All three services run as containers on one `docker compose` network and reach each other by service name (`kanboard`, `gitea`, `marcus`) — only the host-side port mappings (8080, 3000, 4298) matter from outside Docker.

```
Human (browser)
  │  creates project, ticket           │  assigns, sets "Ready"
  ▼                                    ▼
kanboard (container, host port 8080) ← Kanboard JSON-RPC API (internal port 80)
  │  ProjectWatcher polls               │  BoardWatcher polls (30s) + webhook (instant)
  ▼  getAllProjects()                   ▼  getAllTasks()
marcus (container, host port 4298) ─── marcus (container)
  │  GiteaManager*                      │  BranchManager + HumanGatedWorkflow
  ▼  POST /api/v1/user/repos            ▼  git push branch
gitea (container, host port 3000) ──── gitea — branch per ticket

AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
  └── connect to http://localhost:4298/mcp  (MCP protocol)
      ├── request_next_task
      ├── signal_ready_for_review    → Human Gate: "Waiting for Human"
      │                              → AI Gate:    auto-merge + "Done"
      ├── signal_waiting_for_human   → Human Gate: pause for input
      │                              → AI Gate:    post note, continue
      └── post_ticket_progress
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (macOS/Linux) — **2 GB RAM** is plenty (Gitea is lightweight; no GitLab-sized allocation needed)
- `curl`, `python3`, `openssl` (all preinstalled on macOS/most Linux distros)
- Either a **Claude Pro/Max subscription** (run `claude login` on this machine once, beforehand — the setup script picks it up automatically, no API key) **or** a Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) if you'd rather pay per token. See [AI provider](#ai-provider) below.
- An MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

### 1. Run the setup script

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This one command does everything the individually-numbered steps below used to require by hand: starts Kanboard and Gitea, creates the Kanboard project and its six required columns, sets the Kanboard API token and webhook, creates the Gitea admin account and access token, picks and wires up an AI provider for Marcus's own decomposition/analysis calls (see [AI provider](#ai-provider) — no API key prompt), then builds and starts Marcus itself.

It's safe to re-run — every step checks live state before creating or changing anything, so running it again after `docker compose down` is a fast no-op, and running it after `docker compose down -v` (which wipes volumes) re-provisions everything from scratch.

When it finishes it prints the Kanboard/Gitea/Marcus URLs, the Gitea admin password, which AI provider got selected, and the exact `claude mcp add` command for step 2 below — both for connecting from this machine and from a remote one.

<details>
<summary><strong>How the setup script works</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

| Step | What happens | How |
|---|---|---|
| Kanboard API token | Set to a known, generated value — no UI login needed | `API_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN` env var on the `kanboard` container (Kanboard's own app-level auth mechanism) |
| Kanboard project + columns | Created if missing; columns reconciled to `Todo, Ready, In Progress, Waiting for Human, Blocked, Done` | JSON-RPC calls (`createProject`, `getColumns`, `updateColumn`, `addColumn`) via `scripts/provision_kanboard.py` |
| Kanboard webhook | Set to `http://marcus:4298/webhooks/kanboard` so board changes reach Marcus instantly instead of on the next 30s poll | Kanboard has no API for this — it's two rows (`webhook_url`, `webhook_token`) in its own SQLite `settings` table, written directly via `docker compose exec kanboard php -r '...'` (PDO SQLite, the same DB driver Kanboard itself uses) |
| Gitea admin account | Created non-interactively | `docker compose exec -u git gitea gitea admin user create ...` |
| Gitea access token | Generated non-interactively | `docker compose exec -u git gitea gitea admin user generate-access-token ...` |
| AI provider | `claude_subscription` if this machine has an authenticated `claude` CLI; `anthropic` if `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is already in `.env`; otherwise the script fails with instructions instead of prompting | See [AI provider](#ai-provider) |
| Network access | Asks once: allow AI agents on other machines to connect to Marcus, or localhost-only? Defaults to localhost-only if there's no terminal to ask | See [Network access](#network-access) |
| Marcus | Built and started once everything above has produced the values it needs | `docker compose up -d --build marcus` |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong> (if you'd rather do it by hand, or the script fails partway)</summary>

**Start Kanboard and Gitea:**
```bash
docker compose up -d kanboard gitea
docker compose logs -f gitea | grep "Listen"   # Gitea boots in seconds
```

**First-time Kanboard setup:**
1. Log in at http://localhost:8080 (`admin` / `admin`)
2. **Settings → API** — copy the API token
3. **Settings → Integrations → Webhook URL** — set to `http://marcus:4298/webhooks/kanboard`
4. Create a project and add columns: `Todo`, `Ready`, `In Progress`, `Waiting for Human`, `Blocked`, `Done`

**First-time Gitea setup** (`-u git`: the Gitea CLI refuses to run admin commands as root, and `docker compose exec` defaults to root):
```bash
docker compose exec -u git gitea gitea admin user create \
  --username root --password Marcus123! \
  --email root@example.com --admin --must-change-password=false
```
Then log in at http://localhost:3000 as `root` / `Marcus123!` → **Settings → Applications → Generate New Token** (scopes `write:repository`, `read:user`).

**Configure and start Marcus** — put the values you just collected into `.env` (see `.env.example`, including `MARCUS_AI_PROVIDER`/`CLAUDE_API_KEY` — see [AI provider](#ai-provider) below). If using `MARCUS_AI_PROVIDER=claude_subscription`, make sure `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/.credentials.json` exist on this host first (`docker compose up` fails if a bind-mounted file is missing entirely — `./scripts/setup.sh` creates empty placeholders automatically, this manual path doesn't). Then:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build marcus
```

</details>

### 2. Connect your AI agent

Point any MCP-compatible agent at `http://localhost:4298/mcp`. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://localhost:4298/mcp
```

This always works from the same machine Marcus runs on. Connecting from a **different machine** (another laptop, a remote VPS) additionally requires you to have opted in during setup — see [Network access](#network-access).

---

## Network access

`./scripts/setup.sh` asks once, interactively: **"Allow AI agents on OTHER machines to connect to Marcus?"** The answer is written to `.env` as `MARCUS_BIND_HOST` and controls which host interface Docker publishes Marcus's port on:

| Answer | `MARCUS_BIND_HOST` | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| No (default) | `127.0.0.1` | Marcus only accepts connections from this machine. Nothing changes about how you use it locally — this is the default for a reason: it's the safer choice, and it's what most local/single-machine setups want. |
| Yes | `0.0.0.0` | Marcus's port is published on all interfaces, reachable from other machines once your firewall/network allows it. |

Answering **Yes** is what a distributed setup needs — Marcus, Kanboard, and Gitea can each run on separate hosts (see [Independent deployment](#independent-deployment)), with AI agents on individual machines all connecting to Marcus's one MCP endpoint over the network:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://<this-machine's-address>:4298/mcp
```

If there's no terminal to ask (e.g. running the script from CI), it defaults to **No** rather than guessing. To change your answer later, edit `MARCUS_BIND_HOST` in `.env` and run `docker compose up -d --build marcus` again — no need to re-run the whole setup script.

Note this only gates the *port-level* reachability of Marcus's MCP endpoint; it doesn't add authentication in front of it. If you open it to other machines, treat it the same as any other unauthenticated network service — restrict it with a firewall/VPN/security group to just the hosts your AI agents actually run on, especially on a cloud VPS.

---

## AI provider

Marcus's own decomposition, dependency-inference, and effort-estimation calls need an AI provider — separate from whatever auth the coding agents you connect via MCP use for their own work.

`./scripts/setup.sh` never prompts for an API key. It picks a provider automatically, in this order:

1. **`.env` already has `CLAUDE_API_KEY`** → uses the `anthropic` provider (pay-per-token, your existing choice respected).
2. **Otherwise, this machine has an authenticated `claude` CLI** (you've run `claude login` here — the same login Claude Code itself uses) → uses the `claude_subscription` provider. The script bind-mounts your `~/.claude.json` and `~/.claude/.credentials.json` into the `marcus` container (see `docker-compose.yml`), so `claude` CLI calls made *inside* the container ride the same Claude Pro/Max subscription, with no separate API key. Marcus's `Dockerfile` installs the `claude` CLI itself (Node.js + `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) for this.
3. **Neither is available** → the script fails with instructions (`claude login`, or set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` yourself) instead of prompting interactively.

You can also set `MARCUS_AI_PROVIDER` in `.env` yourself to override this — see `.env.example`.

**Trade-offs of `claude_subscription`:** each call spawns a full `claude` CLI process inside the container (several seconds to tens of seconds, versus sub-second for a direct API call), and it shares your subscription's usage limits with any interactive Claude Code sessions on the same account. Sharing `~/.claude.json`/`~/.claude/.credentials.json` into the container also means the container can act as that login for `claude` CLI calls — reasonable for the local/demo use this stack targets (see the Gitea admin password note above), less so for a shared or internet-exposed host. If you'd rather not share host credentials at all, set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in `.env` before running `./scripts/setup.sh` to use the `anthropic` provider instead.

## Full ticket lifecycle

```
Human creates ticket in Kanboard
  → Marcus generates acceptance criteria (AI)

Human assigns ticket + moves to "Ready"
  → Marcus checks project description for tech stack
  → If stack missing: posts clarification comment, moves to "Waiting for Human"
  → If stack OK: creates branch in Gitea, moves to "In Progress"

AI agent works on the branch
  → Posts progress comments at 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 %
  → Calls signal_ready_for_review when done

  Human Gate (default):
    → Ticket moves to "Waiting for Human"
    → Human reviews branch + live preview
    → Human moves card to "Done" → branch auto-merges to main

  AI Gate (AI Verify OFF):
    → Branch auto-merges to main immediately
    → Ticket moves to "Done" automatically
    → No human step required

  AI Gate (AI Verify ON, e.g. verify_count=2):
    → signal_ready_for_review → Round 1 of 2:
        PASS: comment "Round 1/2: PASSED" → agent calls signal_ready again
        FAIL: comment "Round 1/2: Issues Found" → agent fixes → signal_ready
    → signal_ready_for_review → Round 2 of 2:
        PASS: branch auto-merges to main, ticket moves to "Done"
        FAIL: comment "Round 2/2: Issues Found (final)" → agent fixes → signal_ready
              next signal_ready → merges with no further verification
    (LLM errors are fail-open: merge proceeds; kanban errors are fail-safe: default to 1 round)
```

---

## AI Verify

AI Verify adds an independent LLM code-review step to the AI Gate auto-merge path. It is disabled by default and can be toggled per-project or per-ticket from the Kanboard UI.

### How it works

1. The worker AI agent finishes its task and calls `signal_ready_for_review`.
2. Marcus fetches the unified diff between the ticket branch and `main`.
3. A second LLM call is made with a prompt containing the ticket title, acceptance criteria, and the diff. The LLM acts as a senior code reviewer.
4. The LLM responds with a JSON object `{"passed": bool, "findings": [...]}`.
5. **If passed:** the branch merges to `main` and the ticket closes as usual.
6. **If failed:** Marcus posts a "Marcus AI Verifier — Issues Found" comment listing each finding and tells the worker what to fix. The ticket stays "In Progress". The worker reads the comment, fixes the issues, and calls `signal_ready_for_review` again — triggering a fresh verification run. This repeats until the review passes.

### Failure modes and safety

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| LLM API is down or returns garbage | **Fail-open** — merge proceeds. A transient outage should not block shipping. |
| Kanban API unreachable when checking verify setting | **Fail-safe** — verification runs. An outage should not silently bypass the review. |
| Branch diff is empty (no code changed) | **Fail** — verification returns "No implementation found" immediately without calling the LLM. |
| Diff exceeds 12,000 characters | Diff is truncated before sending. Truncation is noted in the prompt so the LLM knows. |

### Enabling AI Verify

**Project level (board header):**
1. Set the project gate to **AI Gate** — the **AI Verify** round counter appears next to it (`[−] 0 [+]`).
2. Click **`+`** to increase the number of required verification rounds (0 = disabled).

**Per-ticket override (task sidebar):**
1. Open a ticket. The **Marcus Gate Mode** panel shows the current effective verify state.
2. When the effective gate is AI, an **AI Verify rounds** counter appears. Use `[−]` and `[+]` to set a per-ticket round count. Click **↩** to reset and inherit from the project setting.

## Independent deployment

Each service deploys independently:

| Service | Compose file | Suggested platform |
|---|---|---|
| Local all-in-one (Kanboard + Gitea + Marcus) | `docker-compose.yml` (root), via `./scripts/setup.sh` | macOS / Linux laptop |
| Kanboard only | `kanboard/docker-compose.yml` | Railway, Fly.io, any VPS |
| Gitea only | `gitea/docker-compose.yml` | Any small VPS (≥ 512 MB RAM) |
| Marcus only | `Dockerfile` (root), or `pip install -e .` + `python -m marcus --http` locally | A cloud VM, or CI, pointed at remote Kanboard/Gitea instances |

**Railway (Kanboard):** push to GitHub, create a Railway service pointing at `kanboard/`, set environment variables in the Railway dashboard. Railway reads `kanboard/railway.toml` automatically.

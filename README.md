# Marcus × Kanboard

A production deployment of **[Marcus](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus)** — the board-mediated AI multi-agent orchestrator — wired to **Kanboard** for ticket management, **GitLab CE** for git repositories, and a custom Kanboard plugin that gives every board a live AI control panel.

> **What Marcus is:** see the [Marcus README](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus) and [docs](https://marcus-ai.dev). This repo is an opinionated deployment of it, not a fork.

## Built on

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| [Marcus](https://github.com/lwgray/marcus) | AI multi-agent orchestrator (MCP server, board watcher, ticket lifecycle, agent coordination) |
| [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org) | Self-hosted kanban board — the shared task board all agents coordinate through |
| [GitLab CE](https://about.gitlab.com) | Self-hosted git — one repo per project, one branch per ticket |

## MarcusDevEnv Kanboard Plugin

The plugin ships in `kanboard/plugins/MarcusDevEnv/` and is automatically active in all supported deployment paths. It adds these panels to every board and task:

### Board header
| Widget | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Active AI Agents badge** | Live green/grey/amber badge showing how many tickets are currently held by an AI agent. Updates every 15 s; hover to see ticket IDs. |
| **Project Description button** | Opens the Marcus-served project description page for this project — the AI agents' shared source of truth for language, framework, and architecture. |
| **Human Gate / AI Gate toggle** | Sets the project-level gate mode. Human Gate (default): AI pauses for human review before done. AI Gate: AI merges and closes autonomously. |

### Task sidebar
| Panel | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Marcus Dev Environment** | Start / Open / Stop a hot-reload preview for this ticket's branch. Any language — stack comes from the project description. |
| **Marcus Gate Mode** | Per-ticket gate override. Shows the project default; lets you switch this ticket to Human or AI gate independently. Ticket setting overrides project setting. |
| **Marcus Dependencies** | Dependency graph: *Depends on*, *Blocks*, *Related* — each with a colour-coded column-status badge. |

## Architecture

```
Human (browser + Kanboard)
  │  creates project                  │  creates ticket, assigns, sets "Ready"
  ▼                                   ▼
Kanboard (port 8080) ←──────────── Kanboard JSON-RPC API
  │  ProjectWatcher polls              │  BoardWatcher polls / webhook
  ▼  getAllProjects()                  ▼  getAllTasks()
Marcus (local, port 4298)        Marcus (local)
  │  GitLabManager                     │  BranchManager + HumanGatedWorkflow
  ▼  POST /api/v4/projects             ▼  git push branch
GitLab CE (port 8929)           GitLab CE — branch per ticket

      ├── signal_waiting_for_human   → Human Gate: pause for input

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (macOS/Linux) with **≥ 6 GB RAM** allocated (GitLab needs it)
- Python 3.11+
- An MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

### 1. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Kanboard is ready in ~5 seconds. GitLab takes **3–10 minutes** on first boot:

```bash
docker compose logs -f gitlab | grep "GitLab is ready to serve"
```

| Service | URL | Default credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Kanboard | http://localhost:8080 | `admin` / `admin` |
| GitLab CE | http://localhost:8929 | `root` / `Marcus123!` |

### 2. First-time Kanboard setup

1. Log in at http://localhost:8080
2. **Settings → API** — copy the API token
3. **Settings → Integrations → Webhook URL** — set to:
   ```
   http://host.docker.internal:4298/webhooks/kanboard
   ```
4. Create a project and add columns: `Ready`, `In Progress`, `Waiting for Human`, `Blocked`, `Done`

### 3. First-time GitLab setup

1. Log in at http://localhost:8929
2. **Edit Profile → Access Tokens** — create a token with `api` + `write_repository` scopes

### 4. Configure Marcus

```bash
export KANBAN_PROVIDER=kanboard
export KANBOARD_URL=http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc.php
export KANBOARD_API_TOKEN=<your-kanboard-token>
export KANBOARD_PROJECT_ID=1
export GITLAB_URL=http://localhost:8929
export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your-gitlab-pat>
export MARCUS_URL=http://localhost:4298
```

Or set these in `config_marcus.json`:

```json
{
  "kanban_provider": "kanboard",
  "kanban": {
    "kanboard_url": "http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc.php",
    "kanboard_api_token": "YOUR_KANBOARD_TOKEN",
    "kanboard_project_id": 1
  },
  "gitlab_url": "http://localhost:8929",
  "gitlab_token": "YOUR_GITLAB_PAT"
}
```

### 5. Start Marcus

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m marcus --provider kanboard
```

### 6. Connect your AI agent

Point any MCP-compatible agent at `http://localhost:4298/mcp`. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http marcus http://localhost:4298/mcp
```

## Full ticket lifecycle

```
Human creates ticket in Kanboard
  → Marcus generates acceptance criteria (AI)

Human assigns ticket + moves to "Ready"
  → Marcus checks project description for tech stack
  → If stack missing: posts clarification comment, moves to "Waiting for Human"
  → If stack OK: creates branch in GitLab, moves to "In Progress"

AI agent works on the branch
  → Posts progress comments at 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 %
  → Calls signal_ready_for_review when done

  Human Gate (default):
    → Ticket moves to "Waiting for Human"
    → Human reviews branch + live preview
    → Human moves card to "Done" → branch auto-merges to main

  AI Gate:
    → Branch auto-merges to main immediately
    → Ticket moves to "Done" automatically
    → No human step required
```

## Independent deployment

Each service deploys independently:

| Service | Compose file | Suggested platform |
|---|---|---|
| Local all-in-one | `docker-compose.yml` (root) | macOS / Linux laptop |
| Kanboard only | `kanboard/docker-compose.yml` | Railway, Fly.io, any VPS |
| GitLab only | `gitlab/docker-compose.yml` | Dedicated VPS (≥ 4 GB RAM) |
| Marcus | runs locally, no Docker | Your laptop, a cloud VM, or CI |

**Railway (Kanboard):** push to GitHub, create a Railway service pointing at `kanboard/`, set environment variables in the Railway dashboard. Railway reads `kanboard/railway.toml` automatically.

# scripts/setup.sh — one-command first-time setup for the Marcus +
# Kanboard + Gitea stack.
#
# Provisions everything the manual README steps used to require by hand:
#   - Kanboard: app-level API token (via env var, no UI login)
#   - Kanboard: the target project + its six required columns
#   - Kanboard: the outbound webhook (instant board updates instead of
#     Marcus's 30s poll)
#   - Gitea: admin account + access token
# then builds and starts all three containers.
#
# Safe to re-run: every step checks live state before creating or
# updating anything (see README.md's "How the setup script works" for
# details). Re-running after `docker compose down` is a fast no-op pass;
# re-running after `docker compose down -v` re-provisions everything.
#
# AI provider: this script never prompts for a Claude API key. If this
# machine already has an authenticated `claude` CLI (i.e. you've run
# `claude login` here, the same login Claude Code itself uses), it
# mounts that login into the marcus container and configures Marcus's
# own decomposition/analysis calls to ride your Claude Pro/Max
# subscription (MARCUS_AI_PROVIDER=claude_subscription) — no separate
# API key, no prompt. If `.env` already has CLAUDE_API_KEY set, that
# choice is respected instead (MARCUS_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic). If neither
# is available, the script fails with instructions rather than prompting.

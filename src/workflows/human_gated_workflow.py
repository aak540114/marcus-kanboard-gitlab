"""
Human-gated AI workflow orchestrator.

This module ties together the board watcher, ticket lifecycle manager,
acceptance criteria engine, git branch manager, comment protocol, and
dev environment manager into the end-to-end workflow described below.

Full lifecycle
--------------
1. ``BoardWatcher`` detects a new (or existing) ticket.
2. If no Marcus AC block exists, ``ACGenerator`` produces one and posts
   it as a comment.  The AC is also embedded in the ticket description.
3. The board watcher polls until a human **both** assigns the ticket to
   themselves **and** moves it to the ``ready`` kanban column.
4. On the ready trigger, a ``ticket/{provider}/{id}`` branch is created,
   the kanban column is set to ``in progress``, and the AI agent is
   notified via a Marcus comment on the ticket.
5. The AI agent works, posting periodic progress comments.
6. When the AI agent signals completion (or needs human input), the
   ticket moves to ``waiting for human`` and a matching comment is posted.
7. If the human responds, the AI re-reads the comments and continues on
   the same branch; the kanban column returns to ``in progress``.
8. When the human marks the ticket ``done``, the branch is merged to
   main, a "Merged" comment is posted, and the lifecycle state is ``DONE``.
9. If the human later reopens the ticket, the branch is rebased on main
   and work resumes from step 5.

Hot-reload preview
------------------
At any point a human can comment ``@marcus start-dev-env`` on the ticket
(or click a button in a future UI) to spin up a hot-reload dev
environment on the ticket branch.  The URL is posted back as a comment.

Status model
------------
The six kanban column names that Marcus understands are::

    todo  →  ready  →  in progress  ⇄  waiting for human
                            │
                        blocked (dependency)
                            │
                           done  →  (branch merged, REOPENED if reopened)

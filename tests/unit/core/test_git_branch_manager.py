"""
Unit tests for BranchManager's failure-path git hygiene.

All git subprocess calls are mocked via BranchManager._git — no real git
repository or subprocess is involved. These tests pin the behavior that a
FAILED multi-step git sequence must leave the shared working tree clean:
a conflicted `git merge` (or a conflicted `git pull` inside merge_to_main)
plants MERGE_HEAD in the repo, and without an explicit `git merge --abort`
every subsequent git operation for every other ticket fails with
"you have not concluded your merge".
